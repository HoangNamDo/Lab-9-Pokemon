# Working with Pandas

## You will be using a Pokemon csv file to build a program that will give users the options to do the following tasks:

* 1 - Print out a report with only the following fields displaying - Name, Type, Generation

* 2 - Print out a report displaying the name, HP, Attack, Defense, Speed 

* 3 - Create a dataFrame displaying all of the GRASS type Pokemon in the csv file

* 4 - Create a dataFrame displaying all of the Pokemon in order of HP (highest to lowest)

* 5 - Create a dataFrame displaying all of the Pokemon in order of NAME A-Z

* 6 - Create a dataFrame of all the LEGENDARY Pokemon. 

* 7 - Create a search for a name of a Pokemon and return the data associated with the Pokemon. Do a try/except to catch any error or record not found. Allow the user to search multiple times until they choose to exit.

## Remember to do the following:

* Create a title for your program.

* Create a menu with options 1 - 7 for the corresponding tasks above.

* Allow users to keep inputting options until they choose to exit the program.

* Comment your code. Include your name, date, class number in the top of the file. 

* Consider the user experience and format of the output.

* Have fun!
